My mid-September 2021 photo of [**NGC6888 aka Crescent Nebula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Nebula).

### Object	

Crescent Nebula is a 25 light-year-wide emission nebula in constellation Cygnus formed by the collision of stellar winds from a [Wolf-Rayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star) star. It is about 5000 light-years away from Earth.

### Color palette

Here I used H-S-O for R-G-B mapping with Ha, SII, and OIII filter data. Thus, on this image you can see hydrogen as red and oxygen as blue.

### Location

Home observatory-on-balcony in Cottbus, Germany.
