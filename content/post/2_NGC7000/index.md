Here is my first attempt to capture [****NGC7000 aka North America Nebula****](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America_Nebula). 

### Object	

The NGC7000 is a large emission nebula located in the vicinity of [**Deneb**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deneb), the brightest star in Cygnus (it is not in the field of view of this image).

The nebula covers a very large region of a night sky -  120 x 100 arc minutes - that is about ten times the area of the full moon. 

Interestingly, the distance to NGC7000 is a subject of debate. The evaluations in scientific literature vary by factor 10x, although currently most astronomers accept a value of 600 pc Â±50 pc (~2000 light years). The reason for is that there are few precise methods for determining how far away HII regions lie. Your can read [**Star Formation and Young Clusters in Cygnus**](https://web.archive.org/web/20190308120857/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e821/4b5365785f4681e6e363a5b38c2998bb8584.pdf) amazing research article by Bo Reipurth and Nicola Schneider to learn more about it :)
