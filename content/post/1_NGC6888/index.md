My mid-September 2021 photo of [****NGC6888 aka Crescent Nebula****](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Nebula).

### Object	

Crescent Nebula is a 25 light-year-wide emission nebula in constellation Cygnus. It is formed by the collision of stellar winds from a [**Wolf-Rayet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star) star â€“ known as [**WR 136**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_136). The nebula is about 5000 light-years away from Earth. The [**WR 136**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_136) is nearing the end of its life and is expected to explode as a [**supernova**](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/) within a few hundred thousand years.

### Color palette

Here I used H-S-O for R-G-B mapping with Ha, SII, and OIII filter data. Thus, on this image you can see hydrogen as red and oxygen as blue.

### Location

Home observatory-on-balcony in Cottbus, Germany. 

### For nerds
