The [****NGC6992 aka The Eastern Veil Nebula****](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Nebula). Early September 2021.

### Object	

NGC 6992 is a very beautiful supernova remnant located in ca. 2400 light-years away from Earth in the constellation [Cygnus](https://astrobackyard.com/cygnus-constellation/). The oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen composition of this nebula creates the stunning flame-like structure.

The estimated age of the remnant is 1–2 × 10^4 yr. At the time of explosion of the source massive star, the supernova could have been visible in daytime! The remnants have since expanded to an area of 65 ly in radius. The object thus covers a huge area of the night sky (apparent diameter is ~3 degrees). That about 6 times the diameter of the full Moon. The structure is so large that several NGC numbers were assigned to brightest parts of the nebula:

### Color palette

I used H-O for R-B mapping with Ha, OIII filter data (here no sulfur-II data). On this image, ou can see hydrogen as orange/yellow and oxygen as blue.

### Location

Home observatory-on-balcony in Cottbus, Germany.
