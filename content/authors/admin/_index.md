Welcome! I am a researcher at the Department of [**Digital Transformation in Energy Systems (ENSYS)**](https://tub-ensys.github.io/) @ TU Berlin. 

My research stands at the intersection of economics and operations research. My objective is to provide empirical and computational evidence to guide public- and private sector stakeholders in dealing with new and emerging challenges of energy transition. 

I believe in open science, and I try to contribute by sharing my code, data and teaching materials.

Aside of my research, I enjoy astrophotography, reading about space exploration, related scientific discoveries or just good sci-fi books.
