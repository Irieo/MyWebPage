Welcome! I am a research scientist with expertise in energy economics, energy policy, operations research, and related programmable matter. I am particularly interested in mathematical models, their applications to real world problems, their limitations, and their impacts on decision making.

Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [**Energy Systems group**](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ensys) @ TU Berlin. The overarching goal of our work is to find cost-effective opportunities for climate neutrality. 

Aside from my research, I enjoy astrophotography, reading about space exploration, related discoveries and just good sci-fi books. I believe in the value of open science, and I try to contribute by sharing my research code, data and teaching materials.
