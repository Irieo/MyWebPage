Welcome! I am a research scientist specializing in energy economics, energy policy, operations research, and programmable matter. My work focuses particularly on mathematical models in the energy field---their applications to real-world problems, their limitations, and their impact on decision-making. I believe in the value of open science and try to to contribute by sharing my research code, data, and teaching materials.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [**Energy Systems group**](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ensys) at TU Berlin. The overarching goal of our work is to identify cost-effective pathways to climate neutrality, leveraging quantitative methods to inform policy and public discourse.

Beyond work, I enjoy astrophotography, reading about space exploration, new discoveries, and just good sci-fi books. When I am done with research, I will become a space cowboy.
