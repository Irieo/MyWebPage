abstract: "A recent article ‘Does the purchase of voluntary renewable energy certificates lead to emission reductions? A review of studies quantifying the impact’ claims that modelling assumptions fro green hydrogen production regarding additionality and national renewable generation targets distort the emission impacts of annual versus hourly matching. In this response, we argue that their critiques of a paper we published in 2023 are unfounded. Contrary to the claims of the authors, our original study shows that annual matching can reduce emissions under flexible operation, even when additionality is not enforced, and that the modelling assumption constraining the renewable generation does not influence the results for annual matching. We argue that emission reductions under annual matching are primarily driven by operational flexibility, the background grid mix and the CO2 price, not by modelling assumptions concerning additionality or the renewable generation target. By relying on selectively chosen scenarios, the article falls short of addressing the complexity of hydrogen certification policies. We argue that a more diverse scenario analysis is crucial for robust and nuanced policy recommendations."
