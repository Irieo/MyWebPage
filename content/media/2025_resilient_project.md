abstract: "RESILIENT research project aims to advance our capabilities in planning energy systems with resilience at their core. In this project we builds upon the PyPSA modelling framework and PyPSA-Eur model, enhancing their features and extending it with stochastic modeling capabilities. Our mission is to develop the first truly multi-vector, open-source energy infrastructure planning model that can handle the complexities and uncertainties defining modern energy systems."

RESILIENT research project aims to advance our capabilities in planning energy systems with resilience at their core. In this project we builds upon the PyPSA modelling framework and PyPSA-Eur model, enhancing their features and extending it with stochastic modeling capabilities. Our mission is to develop the first truly multi-vector, open-source energy infrastructure planning model that can handle the complexities and uncertainties defining modern energy systems.

We are dedicated to advancing the use transparent and diligent scientific workflows for energy system modelling. RESILIENT project team aims to empower researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers by providing accessible tools, comprehensive documentation, and practical training resources for energy system research. Through detailed explanations of our models, data, and methodologies, we support a broad application of PyPSA(-Eur) model environment for decision-making and effective industry applications. We openly share all workshop materials to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the energy community.
