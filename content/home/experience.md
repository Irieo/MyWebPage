      Since 03.2022, I have joined the [ENSYS @ TU Berlin](https://tub-ensys.github.io/) group as a research scientist.
      
      The ENSYS a group of energy system modelers researching the most cost-effective pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in energy systems. ENSYS staff maintain the [PyPSA ecosystem](https://pypsa.org/#about) - an open-source python environment for state-of-the-art energy system modelling. 
      
      My work will mainly be focused on our team's contribution to the  [24/7 Carbon-Free Energy by 2030](https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/) project funded by Google.

      In the period of 10.2014 - 02.2022, I was a research fellow at the [Chair of Energy Economics at BTU](https://www.b-tu.de/en/fg-energiewirtschaft/page). I have carried out research on energy economics & energy systems modeling. The topics included infrastructure investments, decisions under uncertainty, risk-aversion, sector coupling (power- and gas) and energy auctions. In this period, I was also involved in the acquisition and implementation of third-party research projects with energy industry and government stakeholders.
      
      I worked on my PhD under supervision of [Prof. Felix Müsgens](https://www.b-tu.de/en/fg-energiewirtschaft/team/chairholder). My cumulative PhD thesis is titled '*Modeling challenges of modern energy markets: studies on uncertainty, complexity, and constant change*'. Currently, I am waiting for a defence date. I will make thesis available for download here after the defence.
      
      Together with my PhD supervisor, we developed a study course at BTU, named ‘Energy systems modelling’. The class focuses on the intersection of energy economics, operations research and systems modelling. The teaching materials are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Irieo/EnergySystemsModelling-course). The course gets usually very warm feedback from students.
      
      In Autumn 2019, I did a research stay in a [Sustainable Energy Systems Integration & Transitions Group headed by Dr. Madeleine McPherson at UVIC](https://sesit.cive.uvic.ca/), Victoria BC. My work there focused on robust optimization algorithms applied to electricity system expansion problems. Victoria BC is simply a fantastic place.
