title: Mitigating Ukraine's Looming Electricity Crisis

summary: To mitigate an impact of the ongoing electricity crisis in Ukraine, we propose establishing an energy situation room, empowering municipalities, and using market mechanisms to allocate donor support for rapid deployment of technical solutions.

abstract: The ongoing Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure are causing massive power outages. Without coordinated measures, the situation will turn worse in the next winter. Technical solutions to improve the supply-situation exist. However, implementing them quickly requires resources and a high level of coordination. Toward this goal, we propose the establishment of an "energy situation room" for improving information exchange and coordination of Ukrainian energy resilience strategy, along with mechanisms to enable local and private actors to invest in targeted, system-friendly solutions.
